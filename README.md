![License: ISC](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-ISC-blue)

## Description

- The backend setup for this e-commerce site will allow the site owner to
  utilize communication technologies and allows them to compete in the internet
  marketplace.
- The technology used for this application are: node, javascript, mysql2 (npm),
  express (npm), dotenv (npm), sequelize (npm), and nodemon (npm - dev only)
- The biggest challenge was working through sequelize and getting familiar with
  the documentation and how the relationships/associations work from table to
  table.

## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

The following dependencies will be installed:

- mysql2
- express
- dotenv
- sequelize
- nodemon

## Usage

The user will start their server via express and allow the server to start
listening for incoming communication ![usage001](./assets/images/usage001.jpg)

The server will then monitor for incoming messages and be listening on routes of
.../api/categories, .../api/products, .../api/tags
![usage002](./assets/images/usage002.jpg)

The server will be listening for GET requests on the main routes utilizing
sequelize 'FindAll' and will SELECT all records and associated models
![usage003](./assets/images/usage003.jpg)

The server will be listening for GET requests with an extended request (/:id)
utilizing sequelize 'FindByPk' and will SELECT the specific record and
associated models columns ![usage004](./assets/images/usage004.jpg)

The server will be listening for PUT requests with an extended request (/:id)
utilizing sequelize 'FindByPk' and will UPDATE the record
![usage005](./assets/images/usage005.jpg)

The server will be listening for DELETE requests with an extended request (/:id)
utilizing sequelize 'FindByPk' and will DELETE the record and CASCADE DELETES
where setup within the model associations
![usage006](./assets/images/usage006.jpg)

The server will be listening for POST requests on the main routes utilizing
sequelize 'create' and will INSERT the record with all given attributes

### Behind the Code

- The database schema is stored and can be used to create the database with the
  MySQL shell commands <br> ![btc001](./assets/images/btc001.jpg)

- The Database Models are defined within the models folder for Category,
  Product, Tag, and ProductTag: <br>
  ![btc002_1](./assets/images/btc002_1.jpg)<br>
  ![btc002_2](./assets/images/btc002_2.jpg)<br>
  ![btc002_3](./assets/images/btc002_3.jpg)<br>
  ![btc002_4](./assets/images/btc002_4.jpg)

- Associations are configured in the models folder within the index.js<br>
  ![btc003](./assets/images/btc003.jpg)

- Routes are defined within the routes/api folder to perform the CRUD actions
  for each api ![btc004](./assets/images/btc004.jpg)

- Seed file provided can be ran to populate the database <br>
  ![btc005](./assets/images/btc005.jpg)

- Database access is done through variable file utilizing dotenv <br>
  ![btc006](./assets/images/btc006.jpg)

- Express is used to listen for api's and Sequelize is utilized to access and
  perform functions within the database <br>
